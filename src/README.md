# Python scripts

It helps to use the **Tcl**, either by incorporating them into the project or by executing them
for specific tasks:
* *fpga_setup:* prepare the system to run the vendor tools.
* *fpga_wizard:* generates the project files *options.tcl* and an auxiliar *Makefile*.
* *fpga_synt*: run synthesis based on a project file generated with a vendor tool.
* *fpga_prog:* transfer a bitstream to a FPGA or memory.
* *fpga_deps:* collects automatically HDL files which are part of a project.
* *database:* shared data.
