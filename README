FPGA Helpers
============

A Free Software project which consist on a bunch of scripts to use FPGA
development tools in a vendor independent way.

The target development platform is Debian GNU/Linux, but it is probably easy
to run in others OS.

Helpers Overview
----------------
* fpga_setup:    used to set the system to execute the tools of the vendors.
* fpga_simu:     generates a Makefile for simulation.
* fpga_synt:     generates a Makefile and two TCL files, which are used to
                 configure and execute a synthesis project.
* fpga_prog:     used to transfer a bitstream to a FPGA or memory.
* fpga_report:   -- ToDo --
* fpga_board:    -- ToDo --
* fpga_compare:  -- ToDo --
* fpga_list:     -- ToDo --
