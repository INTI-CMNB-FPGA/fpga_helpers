                                  FPGA Helpers

A Free Software project which consist on a bunch of scripts to use FPGA
development tools in a vendor independent way.

The target development platform is GNU/Linux (more precisely, Debian), but is
probably easy to port to another OS, maybe using emulators (such as Cygwin).
